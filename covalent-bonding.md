# Covalent Bonding

In covalent bonding atoms share electrons to achieve stability. This sharing can occur between atoms of the same element (like in $O_2$, $N_2$, or $Cl_2$) or atoms of different elements (like in $H_2O$, $CO_2$, or $CH_4$).

Covalent bonds can create molecules. For example, two oxygen atoms share two pairs of electrons (double bond) to make an $O_2$ molecule.

In the solid state, these molecules might arrange themselves in a molecular crystal lattice. For example, solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is made of CO₂ molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces.

Alternatively, covalent crystals can form where the entire solid is one giant network of covalently bonded atoms, like in diamond (each carbon is bonded to four others in a tetrahedral lattice).

Covalent bonding is extremely common and diverse:

It appears in homonuclear diatomic molecules (X₂) like H₂, Cl₂, O₂, and N₂. Notice that some of these molecules can have multiple bonds. For instance:

N₂ has a triple bond (very strong).

O₂ has a double bond.

It also appears in larger molecules (Xₙ where n > 2) such as:

S₈ (a crown-shaped molecule with eight sulfur atoms).

P₄ (a tetrahedral cluster of phosphorus).

Covalent bonds dominate in organic compounds (almost all of them) and many inorganic ones as well.

A. Lewis Theory (1916)
Gilbert N. Lewis proposed that atoms share electrons to achieve noble gas configurations (the “octet rule”). His model uses Lewis structures (also called Lewis dot diagrams) to represent shared and unshared electron pairs.

Example: H₂O is drawn with two H atoms each sharing a pair of electrons with oxygen, plus two lone pairs on the oxygen.

Though Lewis theory is quite basic and often too simplistic, it is still very useful for quick visualization.

B. Quantum Mechanical Models
Two more advanced theories arise from quantum mechanics:

Valence Bond Theory (VB, or EV in Spanish)
This model builds on the Lewis idea but treats electrons as quantum waves that can overlap (hybridize) between atoms. It is relatively intuitive and closely aligns with chemists’ thinking about local bonds.

Example: In H₂, each H atom contributes one 1s orbital, and these overlap to form a covalent bond.

Molecular Orbital Theory (MO, or OM in Spanish)
This model treats all the electrons in a molecule as belonging to the whole molecule, forming molecular orbitals that can spread over several atoms. It’s mathematically more complex and less intuitive but captures delocalization phenomena (like in benzene’s π bonds). Physicists often use this approach because it’s highly general and rigorous.

Gilbert N. Lewis, in 1916, proposed a revolutionary way to understand covalent bonding. According to Lewis, a covalent bond is formed when one or more pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. This sharing allows each atom to reach the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas in its period — which is considered a stable, low-energy state.

In the periodic table:

Most noble gases (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) have eight electrons in their outermost shell (except helium, which has two).

Hence, atoms in molecules tend to "seek" eight electrons in their valence shell — this is known as the octet rule. Hydrogen is an exception, as it only needs two electrons to fill its 1s orbital.

Lewis introduced a very intuitive notation for visualizing valence electrons:

The element symbol represents the atom’s core (nucleus + inner electrons) — in Spanish they also refer to this as the “almendra del átomo” (the “almond of the atom”) though “core” is more standard.

Around the element symbol, dots represent the valence electrons.

Electrons that are paired in the same orbital are shown as a pair of dots next to each other.

Examples:

Hydrogen (H): one valence electron → written as H·.

Helium (He): two valence electrons (filled shell) → written as He:.

Carbon (C): four valence electrons → written as ·C· with four single dots arranged around the symbol.

Oxygen (O): six valence electrons → written as :O· with two pairs and two single dots.

1. Visualizing Molecules with Lewis Structures

The text shows several ways to represent molecules, using chlorine (Cl₂), hydrogen chloride (HCl), oxygen (O₂), and nitrogen (N₂) as examples.

(A) Dots and pairs:
Electrons are shown explicitly as dots.

Cl₂: each Cl atom shares one pair of electrons.

O₂: two oxygen atoms share two pairs (a double bond).

N₂: two nitrogen atoms share three pairs (a triple bond).

(B) Lines:
Each shared pair of electrons is represented as a single line (a common simplification).

Cl–Cl

H–Cl

O=O

N≡N

(C) Mixed notation:
Similar to (A), but uses dashes to represent bonding pairs.

(D) Only bonding pairs:
Only the shared electrons are shown as lines, omitting the lone pairs for clarity.

5. Paired vs. Unpaired Electrons

The text mentions a key point: the concept of spin and electron pairing (introduced in 1925) came after Lewis’s time, but we now know that:

Electrons tend to pair up in the same orbital with opposite spins.

Paired electrons (lone pairs) are non-bonding, while unpaired electrons are available to form bonds.

6. Hybridization and Promotions

For atoms like beryllium (Be) and boron (B):

In the ground state, Be has two paired electrons in the 2s subshell (so no unpaired electrons).

However, in molecules, Be can promote one of these electrons to the 2p subshell — this promotion creates two unpaired electrons, allowing it to form two bonds (as in BeCl₂).

The text’s notation ·Be· indicates the promoted state (two unpaired electrons), while :Be would show paired electrons (no bonding in ground state).

This same idea applies to carbon:

In ground state, carbon has two paired and two unpaired electrons.

Through hybridization, it can effectively have four unpaired electrons, which lets it form four bonds (like in methane, CH₄).

In Lewis notation:

A pair of electrons (whether it’s shared between atoms or unshared on a single atom) can be represented as a pair of dots or a dash (–).

The text explains that:

You can use a dash to represent either:

All pairs of electrons (bonding and non-bonding) — like in some stylized diagrams.

Only the shared pairs (bonding pairs), while lone pairs remain as dots — which is often clearer.

This means that:

The same molecule can be represented in different ways depending on the level of detail needed:

With dots for all electron pairs (A).

With dashes for all pairs (B).

With dashes for bonding pairs and dots for lone pairs (C).

With only the bonding pairs shown (D).

A shared electron pair (pair of electrons forming a covalent bond) is called a bonding pair (or sometimes a shared pair).

An unshared electron pair (a pair of electrons on a single atom not involved in bonding) is called a lone pair (or non-bonding pair).

When two atoms share:

Two pairs of electrons → double bond.

Example: O₂ has a double bond between two oxygen atoms.

Three pairs of electrons → triple bond.

Example: N₂ has a triple bond between two nitrogen atoms.

This is essential because:

Double and triple bonds make molecules stronger and shorter than single bonds.

These bonds affect reactivity, polarity, and physical properties of substances.

Coordinate (Dative) Bonds

Sometimes, one atom donates both electrons of a bonding pair:

This forms a coordinate covalent bond (also known as a dative bond).

This happens when:

One atom has a lone pair of electrons.

The other atom has an empty orbital to accept them.

Example:

In ammonium ion (NH₄⁺):

NH₃ donates a lone pair from nitrogen to a proton (H⁺), forming a coordinate bond.

Limitations of Lewis Theory — Violations of the Octet Rule

While Lewis Theory is helpful, it has limitations, particularly when it comes to predicting the structures of some molecules:

A. Electron-Deficient Molecules (less than 8 electrons)
Example: BCl₃ (boron trichloride)

Boron has only 3 valence electrons.

When it forms three bonds with chlorine, it shares three pairs (6 electrons around boron).

This is fewer than an octet.

Boron does not reach a noble gas configuration, but the molecule is still stable.

B. Expanded Octets (more than 8 electrons)
Example: PF₅ (phosphorus pentafluoride)

Phosphorus (third period element) has 5 valence electrons.

When it forms five bonds with fluorine, it shares five pairs (10 electrons around phosphorus).

This exceeds the octet rule.

C. Explanation of Periodic Restrictions

Elements in the second period (n=2) can hold a maximum of 8 electrons in their outermost shell:

2s (2 electrons) + 2p (6 electrons) = 8 electrons max.

Elements in the third period and beyond (n≥3) can access the 3d subshell (even though it’s higher in energy), allowing them to expand their valence shell and hold more than 8 electrons — up to 2n² = 18 electrons (though in practice, usually 10–12 in most molecules).

This explains why phosphorus in PF₅ can hold 10 electrons and why sulfur in SF₆ can hold 12.

Forcing the Octet Rule in BCl₃

Let’s take boron trichloride (BCl₃).

In its standard Lewis structure, boron has six electrons in its valence shell — it lacks an octet.

Some chemists (or “octet enthusiasts”) might try to force an octet on boron by “borrowing” an electron pair from one of the chlorine atoms.

How would that work?

A lone pair from one chlorine atom could be donated to the boron atom.

This would change the pair from non-bonding on chlorine to bonding between chlorine and boron.

The result:

Boron would now have eight electrons — octet satisfied.

But—here’s the catch:

Chlorine would lose a lone pair it previously owned entirely.

Because chlorine is highly electronegative, it strongly resists giving up its lone pairs.

In this configuration, the boron atom would gain a negative formal charge (extra electron density).

The chlorine atom would gain a positive formal charge (less electron density).

Chlorine is very electronegative, meaning:

It has a strong tendency to hold on to its own electrons — both shared and unshared.

It’s very unlikely to donate a lone pair to another atom, because it would then acquire a positive charge, which is energetically unfavorable for a highly electronegative element.

Therefore:

While it’s theoretically possible to force an octet by transferring a lone pair, this arrangement is less probable in reality.

The standard Lewis structure (boron with 6 valence electrons) is more realistic, even if it violates the octet rule.

The forced octet structure (boron with 8 electrons) involves formal charges and is less stable.

In its standard Lewis structure, phosphorus shares 5 pairs of electrons — a total of 10 electrons in its valence shell — exceeding the octet.

Some “octet enthusiasts” might try to force phosphorus to comply with the octet rule by removing one of the bonding pairs:

That pair would go back to the fluorine atom as a lone pair.

Fluorine would then have a negative formal charge (extra electron density).

Phosphorus would now have only 4 bonding pairs, satisfying the octet but gaining a positive formal charge (less electron density).

By forcing electron pairs to move from shared to non-shared:

A covalent bond can be reimagined as ionic, with opposite charges attracting each other.

The molecule is now represented with formal charges rather than neutral atoms.

However:

Diagrams with formal charges are usually less representative of the actual electron distribution than diagrams with neutral atoms, especially in molecules where all atoms start neutral.

Chemists use the concept of formal charge to help keep track of electron distributions, but in practice:

The real molecule is often a blend (resonance) of several structures.

Those with fewer formal charges usually contribute more to the real structure.

These alternative Lewis structures — with or without formal charges — are linked to a key concept called resonance.

Resonance involves representing the true electronic structure as a blend of multiple Lewis structures (resonance forms).

Some structures contribute more than others depending on their stability (fewer charges, better electronegativity placement).

Resonance: A way of describing the real molecule as a blend of multiple Lewis structures.

## Introduction to the Valence Bond (EV) Method

This method is one of the earliest applications of Quantum Mechanics to explain covalent bonding.

2. Core Concept: Orbital Overlap

According to EV theory:

A covalent bond forms because of the overlap of two atomic orbitals, one from each atom involved in the bond.

This overlap allows the sharing of an electron pair, which is the hallmark of a covalent bond.

For a bond to form via orbital overlap, each orbital involved must contain one electron with opposite spins (i.e., their spin quantum numbers ms = +½ and -½).

Why is this necessary?

Pauli’s Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously in an atom.

However, in a bonding pair, two electrons can share an orbital if their spins are antiparallel.

If both electrons had the same spin, they would repel each other due to the exclusion principle — no bond would form.

Normal Covalent Bond:

Both orbitals initially contain one electron each with opposite spins.

Example: H–H bond in H₂.

Coordinate (Dative) Covalent Bond:

One atom’s orbital contains a lone pair (two electrons).

The other atom’s orbital is empty.

Example: NH₃ donating a lone pair to H⁺ to form NH₄⁺.

However, this second type only forms after all possible normal overlaps are exhausted. That is, coordinate bonds are less common than ordinary covalent bonds and usually arise in specific circumstances (e.g. Lewis bases donating to Lewis acids).

Let’s walk through the formation of H₂ step by step using EV theory.

Step 1: Atoms Far Apart

Two hydrogen nuclei (labeled a and b) are initially far apart.

At this distance, the potential energy of the system is approximately zero.

Step 2: Atoms Approaching

As they come closer, their 1s orbitals begin to overlap.

The potential energy decreases — electrons are now shared and help stabilize the system.

This decrease continues until reaching a minimum energy point — the bond energy.

Step 3: Bond Formation

The minimum energy point corresponds to the equilibrium internuclear distance — the typical bond length.

For H₂, this is about 74 pm (picometers).

At this distance, the 1s orbitals overlap significantly — the electrons are shared in a bonding region between the nuclei.

The system is now most stable — this is the covalent bond.

Step 4: Getting Too Close or Too Far

If the nuclei are pushed closer than the equilibrium distance, the potential energy increases rapidly due to nuclear repulsion.

If the nuclei are pulled apart, the bond weakens — energy is required to separate them.

6. The Role of Electron Spins

The bonding electron pair must have opposite spins (one ms = +½, one ms = -½).

This allows them to occupy the same bonding orbital — essential for a stable bond.

If both electrons have the same spin (both +½ or both -½), no stable bond can form.

Instead, the potential energy curve would show no minimum — the system would remain repulsive.

## The Wavefunction of H₂ in Valence Bond Theory

In the Valence Bond (EV) approach, the molecular wavefunction of H₂ is built by combining simpler, hypothetical structures called canonical (or limit) structures.

Here’s how it works step by step:

Canonical (Limit) Structures
These are idealized arrangements of electrons in the molecule, each represented by its own wavefunction. They are like snapshots of different possible electron distributions, even if none of them fully captures the real molecule.

Wavefunction of the Molecule
The actual wavefunction of H₂ is a linear combination (weighted sum) of the wavefunctions of these canonical structures. 

formula *******

Normalization Factor (N)
This ensures the wavefunction is properly normalized (so that probabilities make sense mathematically). The text mentions that it’s often omitted for convenience in simple explanations.

The passage refers to Figure 3, which shows the variation of potential energy as a function of internuclear distance between two hydrogen atoms.



Antiparallel Spins (Solid Line)

When the electrons have antiparallel spins, their wavefunctions can overlap constructively, leading to bond formation.

As the atoms approach, the potential energy:

Decreases until it reaches a minimum — this is the bond energy (negative value).

The distance at which this minimum occurs is the bond length (Re).

The absolute value of the bond energy is the dissociation energy — the energy required to break the bond and separate the two atoms completely.

Parallel Spins (Dashed Line)

When the electrons have parallel spins, the Pauli exclusion principle prevents them from occupying the same spatial region (since they can’t share the same quantum state).

The result: the potential energy rises continuously, and no stable bond forms.
