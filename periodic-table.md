# Periodic Table

In 1864, Newlands tried to classify the 62 known elements of his time. He arranged them in order of increasing atomic mass. He discovered that after a certain interval , the chemical and physical properties repeated.

In 1869, Meyer and Mendeleev improved on Newlands’ work. They did this by measuring atomic masses more accurately. Mendeleev’s big insight was to create the first Periodic Table where the properties of elements repeated periodically as a function of atomic mass.

Crucial achievement: He predicted the existence of elements that hadn’t been discovered yet by leaving gaps in his table.

Today, we organize elements by atomic number (Z), which is the number of protons in the nucleus. The table is read left to right across each row (**period**). Each element’s position is determined by its atomic number. This arrangement ensures that elements with similar chemical properties appear in the same vertical columns (called **groups or families**).

For artificial elements, the atomic mass isn’t well-defined because these elements decay very quickly. Instead of listing an exact atomic mass, the textbook gives the mass number (A) of **the most stable isotope**—the one that lasts the longest before decaying.

This is crucial because these heavy elements fission spontaneously soon after they form in particle accelerators. So the table indicates their most stable isotope rather than an average atomic mass (like we have for stable elements).

## Periods

A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table. There are 7 periods in total.They’re numbered from 1 to 7.

## Groups

A group is a vertical column in the periodic table.

Elements in the same group share similar chemical and some physical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell).

However: There are **exceptions** where the first element in a group has different behavior than the rest. Example of difference:

Oxygen (O) in Group 16 has significant differences compared to sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), polonium (Po), and livermorium (Lv). Oxygen is a gas at room temperature and extremely reactive. Sulfur and the others are solids and have progressively more metallic character.

Example: Elements in Group 1 (like Na, K) all react strongly with water. Group 17: All halogens tend to form -1 ions (like Cl⁻, Br⁻).

Labeling groups:

Traditionally, groups were labeled with Roman numerals (I to VIII) plus a letter A or B. In modern systems, groups are numbered 1 to 18, which is simpler and internationally standardized.

- Group 1 (IA) (excluding hydrogen): Alkali metals (Li, Na, K, etc.). Soft, shiny, very reactive with water.

- Group 2 (IIA): Alkaline earth metals (Be, Mg, Ca, etc.).

- Group 14 (IVA): Carbon group or carbonoids (C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb).

- Group 15 (VA): Nitrogen group or nitrogenoids (N, P, As, Sb, Bi).

- Group 16 (VIA): Chalcogens (O, S, Se, Te, Po).

- Group 17 (VIIA): Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At).

- Group 18 (VIIIA): Noble gases or inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn).


## Classifications

Classification helps to group elements with similar chemical or physical properties and to make sense of trends and periodicity (recurring patterns).

### Metals vs Non-Metals (and Semimetals)

**Metals**: Good conductors of heat and electricity, usually shiny, malleable, and ductile. Most elements (about 75%) fall into this category.

**Non-Metals:** Poor conductors, dull appearance, brittle in solid form, often gases or liquids at room temperature.

**Semimetals:** On the periodic table, a zig-zag line (staircase) separates metals from non-metals. Elements touching or near this line (like B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, and At) have properties between metals and non-metals. These are called semimetals.

### Hydrogen

Hydrogen (H) is not clearly placed in the metals vs. non-metals group because it shows unique behavior.

Sometimes it acts like a non-metal (forming H₂ gas, making acids like HCl).

Sometimes it behaves like a metal under certain conditions (in stars or under high pressure).

Because of this, hydrogen’s position in the periodic table is ambiguous — a known limitation of the periodic table.


### Natural vs. Artificial Elements

**Natural elements:** Found in nature, have defined atomic masses.

**Artificial elements:** Made in labs (particle accelerators), often unstable with no defined atomic mass — instead, they’re represented by the mass number of their most stable isotope (the one with the longest half-life).

Uranium (U) is natural with a defined atomic mass. Elements after uranium (Z > 92) are artificial and called transuranic elements. Technetium (Z=43) and Promethium (Z=61) are also artificial (even though they have relatively low atomic numbers). 

If the periodic table shows a number in parentheses (e.g., (294)), that’s the mass number of the isotope — indicating the element is artificial.

### Types of Elements by Blocks

Beyond metals/non-metals and natural/artificial, elements can also be classified by which part of the periodic table (block) they belong to, reflecting their electron configurations.

a. **Representative Elements (Main Group Elements)**
- Groups 1, 2, and 13–18.

- Also called block sp elements (because their outer electrons fill the s or p subshells).

- These are the “classic” elements that show clear periodic trends.

- Example: Group 1 (alkali metals) — all have one valence electron, highly reactive.

- Example: Group 17 (halogens) — all have seven valence electrons, very reactive non-metals.

b. **Transition Elements**

- Groups 3–12.

- Also called block d elements (outer electrons fill the d subshell).

- Often metals with variable oxidation states, complex chemistry, and catalytic properties.

- Example: Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu).

c. **Inner Transition Elements**
- The lanthanides and actinides, also known as block f elements (electrons fill the f subshell).

- Lanthanides: Elements La → Lu (atomic numbers 57–71).

- Actinides: Elements Ac → Lr (atomic numbers 89–103).

- These are sometimes called rare earth elements, especially the lanthanides.

## Deficiencies of the Periodic Table

Even though the periodic table is one of the most powerful tools in chemistry, it’s not perfect. 

### The Problem of Hydrogen’s Position

Sometimes placed in Group 1 (IA) with the alkali metals, because it can form acids like HCl, which are similar to the salts formed by alkali metals (e.g., NaCl). 
HCl,H2SO4 .

Oxidarion: Like alkali metals, hydrogen easily loses its single electron, forming H⁺ (proton), which is a key feature of acids and electrochemistry.

Sometimes placed in Group 17 (VIIA) with the halogens, because it can gain one electron to complete its outer shell. → Reduction. When hydrogen gains one electron, it forms H⁻ (hydride ion), similar to how chlorine forms Cl⁻.

### Metals vs. Non-Metals Classification
For some elements, it’s not always obvious whether they’re metals or non-metals just from their position.

Example: Some semimetals (like silicon or arsenic) sit near the dividing line and have mixed properties.

## The Foundations

Linking atomic structure to periodicity.

### Energy Ordering of Sublevels
Electrons fill atomic orbitals in a specific energy order (e.g., 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, etc.).

### Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity

Within a given sublevel (e.g. 2p), electrons fill empty orbitals singly first and have parallel spins before pairing up. Parallel spins arise from quantum mechanical principles — they correspond to lower energy states because of the exchange interaction (a concept from quantum physics that stabilizes parallel spins).

This minimizes repulsion and stabilizes the atom.

Example: For the p orbitals in carbon, each of the three p orbitals gets one electron before any of them get two.

### Pauli Exclusion Principle
No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.

This means each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.

### Aufbau Principle

Aufbau Principle describes how electrons fill atomic orbitals in the ground state (lowest-energy state) of an atom.

This is why the periodic table’s structure emerges from the electron configuration sequence.

Ground State: The unique, lowest-energy arrangement of electrons. Every element has one ground-state configuration.

Excited States: Higher-energy arrangements where one or more electrons occupy higher orbitals. Infinite possibilities theoretically exist (electrons can be promoted to any higher energy level).

Electrons fill sublevels roughly in this order:

1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p < 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p < 7s < ...

For Z > 20, the energy order no longer strictly matches the order of filling — the occupation order and energy order diverge slightly.

The occupation order (the sequence in which electrons fill orbitals) is based on the n + l rule: Lower n + l fills first; if n + l is equal, lower n fills first.

Example:

4s (n = 4, l = 0) → n + l = 4

3d (n = 3, l = 2) → n + l = 5

So 4s is filled before 3d.

But after 4s is filled, its effective energy rises, making 3d energetically lower — but by then, the occupation sequence is already set.

### Order of Electron Removal (Ionization)

Electrons are removed from the highest principal quantum number (n) first.

For example, even though 4s is filled before 3d, 4s has a higher n (4 > 3), so it’s removed first when ionizing. If there are multiple sublevels with the same n (say, 3s and 3p), you’d remove from the sublevel with the highest energy (which typically lines up with the order of filling).

### Exceptions

All electron configurations have been determined experimentally.

Transition metals (d block) and inner transition metals (f block) have exceptions because of

- Electron-electron interactions (especially repulsion and exchange interactions).
  
- Subtle energy differences between sublevels (e.g., 4s vs. 3d, or 5d vs. 4f).

- Quantum mechanical stability when sublevels are half-filled or fully filled—these configurations are often exceptionally stable, making the atom “prefer” them.

For representative elements (Groups A), Procedure 2 usually predicts configurations accurately.

For transition metals (d block) and lanthanides/actinides (f block), exceptions appear more often.

**Before filling 4f (lanthanides), place one electron in 5d after filling 6s (same for 7s → 6d before 5f).** - applies to lathanides (57-71) and actinides (89-103).

**Half-Filled and Fully-Filled**: A sublevel achieves special stability when it is:
Half-filled: np³, nd⁵, nf⁷; Fully-filled: np⁶, nd¹⁰, nf¹⁴

No matter how sophisticated our procedure, some configurations are so subtle that only experimental data confirms them.

### Writing Electron Configurations for Ions

**Cations (Positive Ions)**
- Start with the neutral atom’s configuration (using Procedure 2 Modified).

- Remove electrons from the highest-energy sublevel, which corresponds to the sublevel from which electrons are most easily removed because it’s less tightly bound

Remove electrons from the highest-energy sublevel first, even if it was filled before a lower-energy sublevel during Aufbau filling. **Electrons are removed from 4s before 3d**

**Anions (Negative Ions)**
- Start with the neutral atom’s configuration.
- Add as many electrons as the ion’s charge indicates. Fill the next available sublevel following the filling order 

**Unpaired** Electrons occupy an orbital alone (single arrow).

An electron is **paired** if it shares an orbital with another electron of opposite spin.

An atom or ion is **paramagnetic** if it has one or more unpaired electrons. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to magnetic fields because of the magnetic moment of the unpaired electrons.

An atom or ion is diamagnetic if it has all electrons paired. Diamagnetic substances do not respond to magnetic fields (they’re weakly repelled).

Ferromagnetism - a special case of paramagnetism, where magnetic moments align and can remain magnetized even after the external field is removed.

## sp Block

### Groups IA and IIA (Groups 1 and 2)

ns¹ for Group IA - alkali metals

ns² for Group IIA - alkaline earth metals

### Groups IIIA to VIIIA (Groups 13 to 18)

These are the p-block main group elements.

Their general configuration is:

ns2 np1–np6, depending on the group.

Differentiating Electron: the electron that distinguishes an element from the one before it in atomic number.

The Period (n) determines the principal quantum number of the highest-energy valence electron(s).

The Group determines how many electrons are in the ns and np sublevels.

Atoms with the same general valence electron configuration have similar chemical properties. This is why the periodic table groups elements into families (e.g. alkali metals, halogens).

## d Block

Are also called the transition metals.

Group 3-12.

$(n-1)d^{1-10}ns^2$

Their valence electrons are spread across both ns and (n–1)d sublevels, contributing to:

- Variable oxidation states.
- Complex formation.
- Metallic bonding.
- Catalytic properties.

## f Block

Elements form a separate horizontal block at the bottom of the periodic table.

$(n-2)f^{1-14}(n-1)d^{0-1}ns^2$

- n = 6 or 7, depending on the period.

- (n–2)f is the sublevel being filled with 1 to 14 electrons.
  
  Lanthanides: 4f.
  
  Actinides: 5f.

- (n–1)d may have 0 or 1 electron.

## Valence electrons

Valence electrons are responsible for an atom’s chemical behavior. They:

- Participate in bonding.

- Dictate oxidation states.

- Influence reactivity and physical properties (e.g. metallic, nonmetallic, magnetism).

Atoms in the same group (vertical column) of the periodic table have the same general valence configuration (same arrangement of outermost electrons). Therefore their chemical properties are similar.

Number of valence electrons = group number (except He).

Calcium (Group IIA, Z=20) → 2 valence electrons.

Chlorine (Group VIIA, Z=17) → 7 valence electrons.

For transition metals (d-block): Valence electrons = (n-1)d electrons + ns2 electrons. Iron (Fe, Z=26): 3d6 + 4s2 → 8 valence electrons.

For inner transition metals (f-block): Valence electrons = (n-2)f electrons + (n-1)d electrons + ns² + np⁶ (if applicable). Uranium (U, Z=92): 5f3 + 6d1 + 6p6 + 6s2 + 7s2 → total 14 valence electrons.

For uranium, the 6p⁶ is typically full, but it’s considered valence because its energy is close to that of the higher shells.

# Periodic Properties

## Atomic size

Atoms don’t have a hard edge—electrons exist as probability clouds that can theoretically extend infinitely. Hence, it’s hard to define an atom’s exact size.

Across a Period (Left to Right) the radius decreases.
Reason: As you add protons, the effective nuclear charge increases, pulling electrons closer.

Down a Group (Top to Bottom) the radius increases as you go down a group. Reason: Electrons occupy higher energy levels (n increases), so the electron cloud expands.

For transition metals (d-Block), the radius doesn’t change much across a period because added d-electrons shield each other, making the effective nuclear charge roughly constant. So, in a row of transition metals, atomic size remains relatively stable.

Lanthanides and Actinides (f-Block): similar effect—shielding by f-electrons is poor, so the radius is nearly constant across the lanthanide or actinide series.

### Covalent Bonding Introduction

A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Usually occurs between non-metallic elements (e.g. H, C, N, O, F, Cl).

The goal is for each atom to achieve a full outer shell (usually 8 valence electrons — the octet rule — except for hydrogen and helium, which require 2).

Atoms overlap their outer orbitals to share electrons. By sharing electrons, each atom effectively achieves a stable electronic configuration similar to noble gases.

- Single Bond: One pair of shared electrons. Example: H–H in H₂.

- Double Bond: Two pairs of shared electrons. Example: O=O in O₂.

- Triple Bond: Three pairs of shared electrons. Example: N≡N in N₂.

**Non-Polar Covalent Bond:**

Equal sharing of electrons. Typically, between identical atoms (H–H, Cl–Cl) or atoms with very similar electronegativities (C–H).

**Polar Covalent Bond:**

Unequal sharing of electrons.

One atom pulls the shared electrons closer, creating a partial negative charge on that atom and a partial positive charge on the other. Example: H–O in water (H2O).

Properties of Covalent Compounds

- Low melting and boiling points (usually gases, liquids, or low-melting solids).

- Do not conduct electricity

- Usually insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents.

- Soft and brittle (some exceptions, like diamond — a giant covalent structure).

### Simple covalent radius

The covalent radius is half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms joined by a single covalent bond.

For identical atoms (A–A): $r_{A} = 1/2 \cdot r_{A-A}$

For different atoms (A–B): $r{A-B} = r_A + r_B$

Smaller than metallic radii, because the atoms share electron pairs in a directional way.

### Metallic Bonding Introduction

Metallic bonding is a type of non-directional covalent bonding in which many metal atoms collectively share their valence electrons in a delocalized “sea.” Each atom contributes its valence electrons to the electron sea, but retains its core electrons tightly bound.

Instead of one pair of atoms sharing electrons (like in a single covalent bond), thousands of atoms share electrons collectively. Valence electrons are free to move anywhere throughout the metal lattice. This delocalization means electrons are not fixed to any single atom.

Because the valence electrons are free to move, metals can conduct electricity:

- Without an electric field: the electron movement is random

- With an electric field (voltage): electrons drift toward the positive terminal, creating an electric current.

When metals form a solid, each atom loses its valence electrons to the electron sea, leaving behind a positive ion (cation).

These cations: 

- Are arranged in a regular, repeating lattice.

- Are surrounded and “glued” together by the sea of electrons.

The electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions (cations) and the negatively charged electron sea holds the structure together—this is the metallic bond.

Physical Properties:

- Strength, high melting and boiling points: metallic bonds are strong—it takes a lot of energy to separate the cations from the electron sea.

- Electrical conductivity

- Malleability and ductility: The delocalized electrons can flow around when metal ions slide past each other, so metals can bend or be drawn into wires without breaking the bonds.

Alloys - mixtures of metals or metals with small amounts of non-metals (e.g., carbon in steel).

Different atom sizes disrupt the regular lattice, making it harder for the metal ions to slide past each other. Therefore, alloys are usually stronger and harder than pure metals. Example: Steel: iron + carbon (and sometimes other metals).

### Metallic Radius

The metallic radius is half the distance between two neighboring nuclei in the metallic crystal.

It is measured in solid metallic crystals, where electrons are delocalized and form a “sea of electrons” that allows metal atoms to slide past one another. Due to this delocalized bonding, metallic atoms often “pack” a bit looser than in covalent bonds.

The metallic radius is always larger than the covalent radius because metallic bonding involves a cloud of delocalized electrons, allowing the nuclei to be a bit further apart on average.

Covalent bonds are stronger directional bonds that pull atoms closer together.

For a metal, the metallic radius is measured by analyzing the crystal structure—often using X-ray diffraction.

### Van der Waals radius

### Ionic Bonding Introduction

An ion is an atom (or group of atoms) that has gained or lost one or more electrons to achieve electronic stability, usually by forming a full outer electron shell (like a noble gas).

Ionic bonding typically occurs between metals and non-metals:

- Metals (like Na) lose electrons easily due to low ionization energy → cations.

- Non-metals (like Cl) gain electrons easily due to high electron affinity → anions.

Electron transfer is driven by the desire to reach a stable noble gas configuration.

After electron transfer: Na+ and Cl- have opposite charges. They attract each other strongly via electrostatic forces. This attraction is the ionic bond.

Ionic compounds are not made of individual Na+Cl- molecules. Instead, they form giant three-dimensional crystalline lattices: each cation is surrounded by anions and vice versa. Repeats in all directions — forming a solid with high lattice energy.

Lattice Energy - the energy released when gaseous ions come together to form the crystal lattice. It’s a measure of the strength of the ionic bond in the solid.

### Ionic radius

The ionic radius describes the effective size of an ion—an atom that has gained or lost one or more electrons. Unlike the covalent and metallic radii (defined for neutral atoms), the ionic radius applies only to charged atoms (ions).

It’s defined so that in a crystal lattice (typically an ionic solid), the sum of the radii of a cation and an anion equals the internuclear distance (also called interionic distance) between their nuclei.

$r_0 = r^+ + r^-$

Ionic Radii Change with Charge:

a. Cations (Positive Ions)
Smaller than their parent atoms.

When an atom loses one or more electrons, its effective nuclear charge increases because there are fewer electrons to shield the nucleus. This increased pull draws the remaining electrons closer.

b. Anions (Negative Ions)
Larger than their parent atoms.

When an atom gains one or more electrons, the nucleus has the same charge but now has to attract more electrons. Electron–electron repulsion also spreads the electron cloud out. Effective nuclear charge decreases, so the radius increases.

Isoelectronic species are ions or atoms with the same number of electrons.
Example: S2-, Cl-, Ar, K+, and Ca2+ all have 18 electrons.

They have identical electron configurations, but their radii vary due to nuclear charge.

As the nuclear charge increases (Z increases), the electrons are pulled in more tightly. So the ionic radius decreases as Z increases.

### Ionization energy

Also called ionization potential of an atom, is the minimum energy required to remove an outermost electron from an atom in its ground state and in the gaseous state. In the gaseous state, atoms are far apart—no interaction with neighboring atoms. This prevents bonding effects from influencing the measurement.

$X = X^+ + e^-$

Energy required to remove the first electron: I1, Energy required to remove the second electron from the already positively charged ion: I2, Energy required to remove the third electron from X2+: I3.

For a neutral atom with atomic number Z, there are Z ionization potentials.

$I_1<I_2<I_3...$

After removing one electron, the nucleus has the same positive charge, but fewer electrons to “shield” the nuclear charge. The remaining electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus. More energy is required to remove the next electron.

Once the atom becomes positively charged, removing another negatively charged electron means working against a stronger attraction.

Across a Period ionization energy increases from left to right; nuclear charge increases → electrons are pulled closer → harder to remove. Atoms get smaller, so valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and feel a stronger effective nuclear charge

Down a Group: Ionization energy generally decreases from top to bottom; outer electrons are in higher shells (larger n) → farther from the nucleus → easier to remove.

Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) have the highest ionization energies in each period. They have full valence shells, which are extremely stable. Removing an electron would break this stable configuration → requires a lot of energy.

Alkali Metals (Li, Na, K, etc.) have the lowest ionization energies in each period. They have one valence electron, which is relatively loosely held and easily lost to achieve a stable noble gas configuration. This is why they’re so reactive: they easily lose an electron to form a cation.

Exception example: Nitrogen (N) has a higher first ionization energy than oxygen (O), because Nitrogen 2p sublevel is half filled, which makes it very stable, meanwhile in O, there’s a paired electron in one of the 2p orbitals Electron-electron repulsion between the paired electrons makes it easier to remove one → lower ionization energy than N.

The General Rule: Half-filled (e.g. p3, d5, f7) and fully-filled sublevels (e.g. p6, d10) are especially stable.

### Electron affinity

The electron affinity (also called electroaffinity and denoted by E or A) is the energy change that occurs when a gaseous atom (isolated, very far from other atoms so interactions can be ignored) gains an electron. It measures how strongly an atom attracts an additional electron to form a negative ion.

$X + e^- \rArr X^{-}$

Positive electron affinity: Energy is released when the atom gains an electron.

The atom wants the electron—it’s stable as an anion.

Example: Halogens (e.g. Cl) release energy because the anion achieves a noble gas configuration.

Negative electron affinity: Energy is required (absorbed) to force the atom to accept an electron.

The atom doesn’t want the electron—it’s unstable as an anion.

Example: Noble gases resist adding electrons.

Important:

The sign convention here is opposite to that of ionization energy.

Ionization energy is always positive because energy must always be supplied to remove an electron.

Electron affinity can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the process is energetically favorable.

Across a Period (left to right):

Electron affinity generally increases until the noble gases.

Atoms on the right (nonmetals) are more eager to gain an electron to fill their valence shell.

Noble Gases:

Have a negative electron affinity.

Their electron configuration is already stable, so adding an electron requires energy input.

Down a Group:

Electron affinity tends to decrease, though the trend is less regular.

Reason: The additional electron would enter a higher shell (farther from the nucleus), where it’s less strongly attracted.

Halogens (e.g. F, Cl) need just one electron to achieve a noble gas configuration.

This makes the process of gaining that electron highly exothermic—lots of energy is released.

Some atoms (N, O, P, S, etc.) can, in theory, gain more than one electron.

However: Every subsequent electron must enter an already negative ion (repelled by existing electrons), so:

Second, third, etc. electron affinities are always negative.

Energy must be added to overcome repulsion.

The electron affinity of a neutral atom equals the ionization energy of its anion.

Example:

The electron affinity of fluorine (F) = ionization energy of the fluoride ion (F⁻).

The electron affinity of the Be⁺ ion = ionization energy of neutral Be.

This is because both processes involve adding or removing an electron from the same electronic structure, just in reverse directions.

### Electronegativity


# Chemical Bonding

Atoms bond with each other to achieve greater stability and minimize energy. 

Isolated atoms have higher potential energy because their electrons are in less stable arrangements. By forming bonds, atoms rearrange their electrons to achieve a lower energy state, making them more stable than when they’re alone.

When atoms bond in specific proportions (e.g., always 2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen in water), they form molecules. 

**Molecular crystal** (or solid molecular) happens if many of these molecules come together in a solid, they may arrange themselves in a repeating 3D. These are held together by intermolecular forces, which are generally weaker than the bonds within a molecule but still help form a stable solid.

Sometimes, molecules can be very large and complex, with the number of atoms not fully defined or varying slightly (like polymers). These are called **macromolecules**. Examples: Proteins (thousands of atoms); Polymers.

**A network solid** (also known as a covalent network solid) is a solid where every atom is covalently bonded to its neighbors throughout the entire solid — forming a continuous three-dimensional network.

The solid is not made of individual molecules; instead, it’s a repeating, ordered network.

A key feature here is that the number of atoms in the solid is not specific—it can vary and extend indefinitely.

## Ionic Solids

In these solids the lattice points (the ordered positions in the crystal structure) are occupied by ions — both positive (cations) and negative (anions). There are no discrete “NaCl molecules” — just an extended array of ions. These ions can be monoatomic (like Na+, Cl-) or polyatomic (like NH4+, NO3-, OH-).

These ions stay together due to strong electrostatic forces, also known as ionic bonds, between oppositely charged particles.

**Melting Ionic Solids**. When an ionic solid is heated to its melting point, the crystal lattice breaks down. The rigid structure collapses, and the ions can move freely (they are no longer fixed at lattice points).

The liquid still has some *short-range order*: neighboring ions might still “stick around” each other a bit, but the long-range order of the crystal is gone.

**Ionic Compounds in the Gas Phase.** At very high temperatures or low pressures, the compound vaporizes, but the electrostatic forces are still present - they form ionic aggregates.

Ionic aggregates - clusters of ions sticking together because of their mutual electrostatic attraction. It is any small group of ions held together. They’re not necessarily stable molecules like in covalent chemistry — rather, they’re dynamic clusters.

When only one cation and one anion pair up, that’s called an ionic pair. This is the simplest case.

They are molecule-like, in the sense that they have a definite stoichiometry like a molecule. However, not bound by shared electron pairs, simply by Coulombian forces.

**Dissolving Ionic Solids.** When an ionic solid dissolves in a polar solvent like water, the polar solvent breaks the electrostatic forces holding the lattice together. The ions become mobile and can move freely in solution.

At high concentrations, some ions can come together in solution, forming ionic pairs. Again: If these are one cation and one anion, they are called ionic pairs.

These can be considered molecules because they contain two atoms (one of each element) and are held together by electrostatic attraction.

## Covalent Solids

Here, the lattice points are occupied by atoms. These atoms are bonded to each other via covalent bonds (sharing electron pairs), just like they do in molecules. Examples:

- Diamond: each carbon is bonded to four others, forming a continuous 3D network.

- Quartz (SiO₂): silicon atoms are each bonded to four oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom is bonded to two silicon atoms.

When covalent solids melt, atoms gain mobility, and in the vapor phase they can form molecules if possible (e.g. SiO₂ gas might form SiO and O₂ molecules).

## Metallic Solids

The lattice points are occupied by metal atoms, which can be all the same (as copper) or different (intermetallic compounds like brass). 

These atoms are held together by a metallic bond, which is really a type of covalent bonding but with important differences: Electrons are delocalized, forming an “electron sea” that holds the metal atoms together and explains properties like conductivity and malleability.

When metallic solids vaporize, atoms can also form molecules in the gas phase.

## Crystals vs. Macromolecules

Ionic, covalent, and metallic solids are often called non-molecular solids because they don’t consist of discrete molecules.

However, because they contain a large, indefinite number of atoms bonded together, sometimes people refer to these as macromolecules.

But there’s a key difference: A macromolecule (like a polymer) doesn’t usually have a strictly ordered 3D structure throughout its whole extent.

In contrast, a crystal has a strict, repeating 3D arrangement (lattice).

Bonds Are Not Always Clearly Separated

The boundaries between bond type (ionic, covalent, metallic) are often blurred, some bonds have mixed character:

- A bond may be mostly ionic but have some covalent character (called polar covalent).

- Metallic bonds can sometimes share features with covalent bonds.

**The Three Strong Bonds**

Ionic bonds: Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.

Covalent bonds: Sharing of electron pairs between atoms.

Metallic bonds: Sharing of delocalized electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.

## Valence Bond Method (VBM)

## Molecular Orbital Method

# Ionic Bonding


Atoms thrive to achieve stability, a noble gas configuration with a filled outer shell. 

### Cations

Metals (low electronegativity) — lose electrons.

- Low ionization energy (I): It doesn’t cost much energy to remove an electron.

- Low electron affinity (E): They aren’t particularly interested in adding extra electrons to their shells.

Examples: sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca).

For an atom to lose an electron, it requires energy input equal to the ionization energy of atom.

Ionization = energy input → endothermic process.

### Anion

Non-metals (high electronegativity) — gain electrons.

- High ionization energy (I): Hard to remove an electron.

- High electron affinity (E): They strongly attract extra electrons.

Examples: chlorine (Cl), oxygen (O), sulfur (S).

This process releases energy equal to the electron affinity of atom.

Electron affinity releases energy → exothermic process.

When these oppositely charged ions come close together, the electrostatic attraction between them is strong — this is the ionic bond.

The electron affinity (energy released by anion) is usually less than the ionization energy (energy required for cation). That means step 1 cannot happen just by step 2 alone. However, as the ions approach, their electrostatic attraction releases additional energy (lattice energy)— this helps overcome the overall energy requirements.

$F = \dfrac{k \cdot | q_1 \cdot q_2 |}{r^2}$

**Polyatomic ions** form when a group of atoms is held together by covalent bonds but carries a net positive or negative charge.

Polyatomic cations: e.g. ammonium ion, NH4+.

Polyatomic anions: e.g. nitrate ion, NO3-; sulfate ion, SO42-.

These polyatomic ions behave like single ions in an ionic compound, interacting electrostatically with their counterions.

**Types of Ionic Compounds**:

Monoatomic cation + monoatomic anion: Na+ + Cl- → NaCl

Polyatomic cation + polyatomic anion: NH4+ + NO3- → NH4NO3

Monoatomic cation + polyatomic anion: Ca2+ + SO42- → CaSO4

Polyatomic cation + monoatomic anion: NH4+ + Cl- → NH4Cl

Ionic compounds may contain multiple types of cations and/or anions. For example, some minerals or complex salts.

Because ionic compounds are not made of molecules, the formula of an ionic compound is empirical. It simply shows the ratio of ions in the crystal, not discrete molecules. NaCl represents a 1:1 ratio of Na⁺ to Cl⁻, but in the crystal lattice, each Na⁺ is surrounded by six Cl⁻ ions and vice versa — extending infinitely.

Unlike molecular compounds, there are no discrete NaCl molecules floating around in solid salt — just an extended 3D array of ions.

### Molecular mass

For molecular compounds, the **conceptual molecular mass** is defined as the average mass (in atomic mass units, u) of a single molecule of that substance. 

*Here, we take all the molecules of a given substance (say, water) and averaging their actual masses as measured in a laboratory using mass spectrometry. Because real samples include isotopes, this value reflects the weighted average of all naturally occurring isotopes.*

Water ($H_2O$) — one molecule contains: 2 hydrogen atoms (1.008 u each) and 1 oxygen atom (15.999 u)


$M(H_2O) = 2×1.008+15.999=18.015 u$

Also for molecular compounds, we have an **operational molecular mass:** The sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecular formula.

This is the calculated value you get by adding up the standard atomic masses from the periodic table of each atom in the molecule, multiplied by the subscripts in the molecular formula. It’s the practical way chemists calculate molecular masses.

$Molecular Mass=\sum(atomic mass \times subscript)$

### Formula mass

In ionic compounds, the solid structure is an extended lattice of cations and anions. There is no discrete unit that we can call a molecule. 

The conceptual definition of molecular mass is meaningless here. The operational definition of molecular mass is also inapplicable, because there is no molecule.

To bridge this gap, chemists introduce the term formula mass.

Formula Mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms shown in the empirical formula of the ionic compound. It’s calculated operationally — exactly the same way we calculate molecular mass, but with the understanding that it refers to the ratio of ions in the lattice.

$M_f(CaCl_2)=40.078+70.906=110.984 u$

We call this formula mass, not molecular mass, because we’re not dealing with molecules.

### Molar Mass

Molar Mass is the mass of one mole of that substance. It is numerically equal to the atomic or formula mass in u, but with units of g/mol. The molar mass is what you actually use in lab calculations to convert between grams and moles.

In molecular compounds (like water, H₂O), we can say:

$1 \space mole\space of\space water = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of $H_2O$.

(One mole is the amount of substance that contains $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles.)

But ionic compounds do not exist as separate molecules in the solid state. Instead, they’re an infinite 3D lattice of ions. So we can’t just count “molecules” of $CaCl_2$ or $NaCl$ — they don’t exist. So we use the **empirical formula** (the simplest ratio of cations and anions) as a reference.

One mole of an ionic compound is the quantity of the compound containing as many moles of each element as the subscripts in its empirical formula indicate.

One mole of $CaCl_2$ contains 1 mol of $Ca^{2+}$  ions and  2 mol of $Cl^-$ ions.

Saying “1 mole of CaCl₂ contains 1 mol of Ca and 2 mol of Cl” is logically equivalent to saying: “1 mole of CaCl₂ contains 1 mol of Ca,” because by the formula, the Cl must be 2 mol anyway. Or, “1 mole of CaCl₂ contains 2 mol of Cl,” because by the formula, the Ca must be 1 mol.

When defining a mole of an ionic compound, you can refer to any one of the elements in the formula — the rest are determined automatically by the stoichiometry of the formula.

**Special Case: Repeated Elements**

Sometimes the same element appears in multiple parts of the ionic formula. For example:

Ammonium nitrate ($NH_4NO_3$):

Consists of polyatomic ions: ammonium $NH_4^+$ and nitrate $NO_3^-$

Total: 2 nitrogen atoms, 4 hydrogen atoms and 3 oxygen atoms.

1 mol of ammonium nitrate contains: 2 mol of nitrogen atoms ; 4 mol of hydrogen atoms; 3 mol of oxygen atoms. 1 mol of ammonium nitrate contains 9 mol of atoms in total.

The molar mass of an ionic compound is the mass of one mole of the compound, expressed in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).

**Operational Definition**: Since ionic compounds have no molecules, we use the formula mass (sum of atomic masses from the empirical formula) and simply convert the units: Formula mass in u → replace u by g/mol → molar mass.

Example: MgCl₂

Mg: 24,305 u

Cl: 35.453 u × 2 = 70.906 u

Formula mass: 95.211 u → Molar mass = 95.211 g/mol

## Ionic Valence

The ionic valence (sometimes called oxidation state, but here specifically meaning the charge after electron transfer) refers to:

The number of electrons an atom gains or loses to form an ion.

It’s written with a numerical value followed by a sign + or -.

### Electronic Configurations of Monoatomic Ions

For monoatomic anions, the electronic configuration usually matches the noble gas configuration in the same period as the neutral atom.

Example: Chlorine (Cl):

Neutral: [Ne] 3s2 3p5 (7 valence electrons); gains 1 electron → Cl-: [Ne] 3s2 3p6 = [Ar]

It now has the same configuration as argon, the noble gas in Period 3.

For monoatomic cations, the result can vary: Often, they lose all valence electrons, resulting in a configuration similar to a noble gas. However, especially in transition metals, the configuration doesn’t always perfectly match that of a noble gas because of partially filled d orbitals.

1. Sodium (Na)
   
   Neutral: [Ne] 3s1; Loses 1 electron → Na+: [Ne]
   
   Matches the noble gas configuration of neon.

2. Calcium (Ca)
   
   Neutral: [Ar] 4s2; Loses 2 electrons → Ca2+: [Ar]
   
   Matches the noble gas configuration of argon.

3. Iron (Fe)
   Can form Fe²⁺ or Fe3+

   Fe2+: [Ar] 3d6

   Fe3+: [Ar] 3d5

   Neither configuration exactly matches a noble gas.

For polyatomic ions, the concept of valence applies to the whole group, not to individual atoms in isolation.

Example: Ammonium (NH₄⁺): Each hydrogen's oxidation state is +4, Nitrogen -3. Result: +1

## Ionic Crystal Structures

When studying ionic solids, ions are treated as rigid spheres. Oppositely charged ions (cations and anions) are assumed to be in contact at their closest approach.

This model is useful for visualizing how ions pack together in a crystal lattice.

The coordination number of an ion in a crystal lattice is the number of oppositely charged ions that surround it and are in contact with it. 

The structure of an ionic crystal depends on:

- Relative sizes of the ions (divide the radius of cation by radius of anion)
  
- Charges of the ions

Each ion tries to maximize its stability by surrounding itself with as many oppositely charged ions as possible (to neutralize its charge) while minimizing repulsion between ions of the same sign and achieving symmetry.

### Typical Geometries and Their Coordination Numbers

**CN = 2: Linear**

The cation is in the center with one anion on each side, forming a straight line.

**CN = 3: Triangular Planar**

The cation is at the center of an equilateral triangle, anions at the vertices.

**CN = 4: Tetrahedral (most stable)**

The cation is at the center of a tetrahedron, anions at the corners. In this case, the anions are as far apart as possible in 3D space.

Alternatively: Square Planar (cation at center, anions at square corners).

**CN = 6: Octahedral**

The cation is at the center of an octahedron, anions at the corners.

**CN = 8: Cubic**

The cation is at the center of a cube, anions at the corners.

For a stable structure, the anions must be in contact with the cation. Mathematically, it means the center-to-center distance between an anion and a cation equals: $r_0 = r_+ + r_-$

### Limiting Radius Ratio

For each coordination type, there’s a minimum ratio (r+/r-) that allows all anions to touch the cation without leaving a gap:

If r+ is too small relative to r-:

The anions wouldn’t all be in contact with the cation at once. A different geometry with fewer anions (lower CN) would be more stable.

- CN = 4 (tetrahedral) → minimum r+/r- ~ 0.225

- CN = 6 (octahedral) → minimum r+/r- ~ 0.414

- CN = 8 (cubic) → minimum r+/r- ~ 0.732

These values come from geometrical calculations.

Sometimes, the ratio is compatible with *more than one* geometry.

Example: r+/r- = 0.3.

Compatible with CN = 2 (linear), CN = 3 (triangular planar), and CN = 4 (tetrahedral). The highest possible CN (here, 4) is preferred because it maximizes stability.

### Limitations of the Rigid-Sphere Model

Real ionic crystals sometimes deviate from these predictions:

Example: KF (potassium fluoride)

r⁺/r⁻ ≈ 1.0 → compatible with CN = 6 and CN = 8.

The ratio is high enough to allow CN = 8 according to the rigid-sphere model, but the observed CN is 6 (octahedral). 

Reason is that real ions aren’t perfect spheres. In quantum mechanics, ions are fuzzy clouds of electron density — there’s no sharp boundary. The overlap of electron clouds can shift the effective size of ions, changing how they pack together.

Other interactions (like van der Waals forces) can also shift the balance.

This means the rigid-sphere model is a simplification — it helps us understand trends but doesn’t predict everything perfectly.

### Effect of Ion Charge on the Crystal Structure

An ionic crystal must be electrically neutral overall. The total positive charge of the cations must balance the total negative charge of the anions.

The charge of each ion thus determines the ratio of cations to anions needed to achieve neutrality and the empirical formula of the ionic compound.

Example: Calcium Fluoride ($CaF_2$)

$Ca^{2+}$ (2+ charge) and $F^-$ (1− charge).

$1 \space Ca^{2+}$ balances $2 \space F^-$.

Hence, the ratio in the lattice is 1:2 (Ca:F).

Once we know the ratio of ions in the empirical formula, we can link that ratio to the coordination numbers in the lattice.

Example: NaCl
Empirical formula: 1 Na⁺ : 1 Cl⁻.

r+/r- ratio ~ 0.56, so CN = 6.

Each Na+ is surrounded by 6 Cl- ions in the solid lattice (CN = 6).

Each Cl- is likewise surrounded by 6 Na+ ions (CN = 6).

Because there’s the same number of Na⁺ and Cl⁻, the coordination number must be equal for both to maintain balance.

Example: CaF2
Empirical formula: 1 Ca2+ : 2 F-.

Each Ca2+ is surrounded by 8 F- (CN = 8).

Each F- is surrounded by 4 Ca2+ (CN = 4).

## Ionic Radii

We continue with the hard-sphere model, treating ions as rigid, non-deformable spheres.

Ions of opposite charge are assumed to touch each other at their closest approach.

The interionic distance (r₀) — the distance between the centers of two adjacent ions of opposite charge — is measured experimentally using X-ray diffraction.

$r_0 = r_+ + r_-$

Example: NaCl

Experimental interionic distance (r₀): about 2.82 Å (angstroms).

Typical radii:

$Na⁺: ~1.02\space\AA$

$Cl⁻: ~1.81 \space\AA$

Sum: $1.02 + 1.81 = 2.83 \space Å$

This validates the hard-sphere approximation.

### Most Common Ionic Crystal Structures

A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice that contains all the essential information about the structure when repeated in 3D space, rebuilds the entire crystal.

The symmetry and arrangement of ions in the unit cell determine the properties of the whole crystal.

A unit cell always contains an integer number of each ion type, ensuring charge neutrality.

It reflects the coordination environment (CN) of the ions.

Examples

NaCl: Each ion is surrounded by 6 oppositely charged ions (octahedral coordination). The unit cell is face-centered cubic (FCC), with each ion at the corners and faces.

CsCl: Each ion is surrounded by 8 oppositely charged ions (cubic coordination). The unit cell is simple cubic, with the cation at the center.

### AB Compounds and NaCl-Type Structure

AB formula means one cation (A) and one anion (B) in a 1:1 ratio. A very common structure among AB-type ionic compounds is the NaCl structure.

Lattice Arrangement: Anions form a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. They occupy the 8 corners of the cube and the 6 face centers.

Cations fill the octahedral holes in the FCC lattice of anions. They themselves also form a face-centered cubic sublattice, interpenetrating with the anions’ lattice.

Result: Two interpenetrating FCC lattices — one of cations, one of anions.

Both sublattices are identical in symmetry and size, shifted relative to each other so that each cation is surrounded by anions and vice versa.

Each ion is surrounded by 6 ions of opposite charge. This is called octahedral coordination. This arrangement minimizes repulsion and maximizes attraction.

Besides NaCl itself, many other compounds adopt this structure:

Alkali halides (except CsCl, CsBr, CsI): NaBr, NaI, KCl, etc.; AgF, AgCl, AgBr; MgO, CaO, SrO; MnO

Counting Ions in the Unit Cell
5.1. Anions

8 at the corners of the unit cell, each shared among 8 neighboring unit cells. 

$8 \times \dfrac{1}{8} = 1 \space anion$; 

Plus 6 at the faces of the unit cell, each shared between 2 unit cells: 

$6 \times \dfrac{1}{2} = 3\space anions$

Total: 4 anions.

Doing same for cations, we get 4 cations in total.

4 cations and 4 anions in the unit cell matches the 1:1 stoichiometry of AB-type compounds.

This symmetry ensures the lattice is electrically neutral overall and highly stable because of maximum electrostatic attraction.

1. Alternative Reasoning
Instead of counting ions explicitly, you could also reason:

Since AB formula means a 1:1 ratio and the crystal is neutral:

The number of cations in the unit cell must equal the number of anions.

But the explicit counting above reinforces why and how these ions occupy different sites.

### CsCl-Type Crystal Structure

The CsCl structure is an AB-type structure (1:1 ratio of cations and anions), but with different geometry compared to NaCl.

Key features:

Anions form a simple cubic lattice:

Anions at the 8 corners of the cube.

Cations (e.g. Cs⁺) occupy the center of the cube.

Important difference from NaCl-type: Unlike NaCl (where each ion is octahedrally coordinated by 6 ions), here each ion has a coordination number (CN) of 8 → each ion is surrounded by 8 oppositely charged ions.

This is called cubic coordination.

Although less common than the NaCl structure, the CsCl structure is adopted by:
CsCl, CsBr, CsI, TlCl (thallium(I) chloride), TlBr, CsCN (cesium cyanide), TlCN (thallium(I) cyanide), CsHS (cesium hydrosulfide).

Since the ratio of ions is 1:1, both the cation and the anion must have the same coordination number 8.

This symmetry ensures electrical neutrality and structural stability.

Each anion shared among 8 neighboring unit cells → contribution 

$8 \times \dfrac{1}{8} = 1\space anion$ per unit cell.

Cations: 1 at the center.

1 cation + 1 anion → matches the AB stoichiometry.

Lattice Energy (U) is the energy released when 1 mole of an ionic compound forms in the solid state from its gaseous ions.

$Na^+ + Cl^- \rArr NaCl$

The energy released in this process is the lattice energy.

Negative sign: By thermodynamic convention, lattice energy released in a process is assigned a negative sign (exothermic).

Why is lattice energy negative? Because forming the crystal is a stabilizing process — the ions lower their potential energy by attracting each other.

Absolute value of lattice energy - the amount of energy that would need to be supplied to break the lattice apart and separate the ions to infinite distance in the gas phase.

If you think in reverse:

Solid → gas: energy absorbed (positive). The absolute value of the lattice energy is the energy required to overcome the electrostatic forces and fully separate the ions.

Higher lattice energy → stronger ionic bonding → higher melting and boiling points, greater hardness.

Example: MgO has a much higher lattice energy than NaCl due to the higher charges (Mg2+ and O2-) and smaller ion sizes.
