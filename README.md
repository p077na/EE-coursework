# EE-coursework

This repository is created and maintained by **Polina Yakovenko** as a public archive of knowledge gained during the undergraduate program in **Electrical Engineering**.

The content is organized by semester and subject, and each folder contains study materials including **theory summaries**, **problem-solving strategies**, **worked examples**, and **solutions**.

All materials are based on my personal understanding of the topics, supported by lectures from the university I attend, textbooks, and scientific articles. Everything in this repository is written in my own words and reflects my interpretation of the material. These notes are **not** copies of official university documents or exams, and all information has been carefully reviewed to ensure clarity and accuracy.

> My goal is not only to document my own academic journey, but also to **inspire, support, and connect with other young engineers**. If my notes or problem solutions can help even one person understand a topic better, then this project is already worthwhile. I hope this repository grows into a space where engineering students feel encouraged, empowered, and never alone in their learning.
